/**
 * A singleton class responsible for holding and managing application-wide events.
 *
 * This class utilizes `mutableStateOf` to allow for observing changes to the current event
 * from Composable functions.  It acts as a central hub for dispatching and handling
 * single-shot events that need to be communicated across different parts of the application,
 * such as displaying a snackbar, navigating to a different screen, or showing a dialog.
 *
 * Events are represented by the `AppEvent` sealed class, which should define the different
 * types of application events that can occur.
