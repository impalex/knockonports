/**
 * Executes a composable block only when the current navigation destination matches a specified route.
 *
 * This function leverages `NavController.currentBackStackEntryAsState()` to observe changes in the
 * current navigation stack.  It then checks if the current destination's route corresponds to the
 * provided `AppNavGraph` type. If a match is found, the composable block is executed; otherwise, it's skipped.
 *
 * @param T The type of `AppNavGraph` to check against the current navigation destination's route.
 *  Must be a reified type.
 * @param block The composable block to execute if the destination matches the specified route.
