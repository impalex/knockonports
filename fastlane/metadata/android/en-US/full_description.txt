A utility for executing port knocking sequences to discreetly open access to services protected by firewalls. Configure custom sequences using UDP, TCP, or ICMP packets with support for both IPv4 and IPv6.

Key Features:

• Protocol Flexibility: Create sequences with UDP, TCP, or ICMP packets. Fine-tune parameters including destination ports, inter-packet delays, TTL, Hop Limit, and packet payload data.
• Automation & Integration: Automatically launch applications (e.g., SSH clients) or open URLs upon a successful knock. Supports integration with other tools via a custom URI scheme for advanced automation.
• Dual-Stack Support: Full compatibility with IPv4 and IPv6 networks.
• Quick Access: Utilize home screen shortcuts and a widget for immediate execution of configured sequences.
• Customization: Adjust the interface with dynamic color themes (Android 12+), custom accents, and light/dark modes. Includes options for improved contrast.
